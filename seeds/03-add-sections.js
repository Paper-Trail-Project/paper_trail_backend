        {title: "Static Vs. Flexible Budgets", content: 'There are two major types of budgets: static budgets and flexible budgets. A static budget remains unchanged over the life of the budget. Regardless of changes that occur during the budgeting period, all accounts and figures originally calculated remain the same. A flexible budget has a relational value to certain variables. The dollar amounts listed on a flexible budget change based on sales levels, production levels or other external economic factors. Both types of budgets are useful for management. A static budget evaluates the effectiveness of the original budgeting process, while a flexible budget provides deeper insight into business operations.', chapter: "Budgeting"},
        {title: "Building a Budget", content: 'In general, traditional budgeting starts with tracking expenses, eliminating debt and, once the budget is balanced, building an emergency fund. But to speed up the process, you could start by building a partial emergency fund. This emergency fund acts as a buffer as the rest of the budget is put in place, and should replace the use of credit cards for emergency situations. The key is to build the fund at regular intervals, consistently devoting a certain percentage of each paycheck toward it and, if possible, putting in whatever you can spare on top. This will get you to think about your spending, too. ', chapter: "Budgeting"},
        {title: "What's an Emergency?", content: 'You should only use the emergency money for true emergencies: like when you drive to work but your muffler stays at home, or your water heater starts to die. You would save money if you used your emergency fund to eliminate credit card debt, but the purpose of the fund is to prevent you from having to use your credit card for paying for unexpected expenses. With a proper emergency fund, you will not need your credit card to keep you afloat when something goes wrong.', chapter: "Budgeting"},
        {title: "Downsize and Substitute", content: 'Now that you have a buffer between you and high-interest debt, it is time to start the process of downsizing. The more space you can create between your expenses and your income, the more income you will have to pay down debt and invest. This can be a process of substitution as much as elimination. For example, if you have a monthly gym membership, cancel it. Use half of the money you save to invest or pay off outstanding debts, and save the other half to begin building a home gym in your basement. Instead of buying coffee from a fancy coffee shop every day, invest in a coffee maker with a grinder and make your own, saving more money over the long term. Although eliminating expenses entirely is the fastest way to a solid budget, substitution tends to have more lasting effects. People often cut too deep and end up making a budget that they can\'t keep because it feels like they are giving up everything. Substitution, in contrast, keeps the basics while cutting down the costs.', chapter: "Budgeting"},

If you simply increase your income without a budget to handle the extra cash properly, the gains tend to slip through the cracks and vanish. Once you have your budget in place and have more money coming in than going out (along with the buffer of an emergency fund), you can start investing to create more income. It is better to have no debt before you begin investing.

        {title: "Daily Savings", content: '1. Brown-bag it - A sandwich at a deli near work can cost $5 to $10 a day. That might not seem like much. But over a year, spending that every work day puts your annual expenditure into four figures. If you instead bring food from home, you can feed yourself for half as much. If you invest those savings—of up to $35 a week, or about $1,800 a year you’d have the tidy sum of about $84,000 after 25 years. 2. Brew your own - A cup of decent coffee at a premium shop can easily run from $2.50 to $4 or more, and that usually won\'t buy you a latte or other specialty drinks. Buy just a single cup every day and you’ll be spending $625 to $1,000 a year—in after-tax money. Then consider that a pound of good coffee at the same store costs about $15 and brews at least 30 cups of coffee. If you brew one cup a day at home, instead of buying one at the store, you would save about $125 a year. Total savings: $500 to $875 a year, and over $90,000 with our lifetime calculation. 3. Join supermarket loyalty programs - Signing up as a loyal customer at a major food chain can allow you access to member-only specials and sometimes to manufacturers coupons, too—the kind that fall out of Sunday papers or you download online at such sites as Coupons.com and Couponmom.com.', chapter: "Saving and Growing Your Money"},

        {title: "Monthly Savings", content: '1. Charge it to a cashback card. Maximize your credit card benefits by putting as many regular expenses as you can on a credit card that offers generous cashback rewards: Groceries, gas, utilities, restaurants, everything you can think of. Make sure, though, that you pay off your credit card bill in full at the end of the month. Paying interest on a balance will wipe out any rewards you’d have earned, and probably more. A family could easily charge $2,000 a month on a rewards card. The Capital One Quicksilver Rewards Card, for example, pays 1.5% back on every purchase. That works out to $30 a month, or nearly $18,000 over 25 years. 2. Shop for home telecom service. Most areas have more than one company that provides cable TV, internet, and landline services. Sometimes there’s a big price difference between them. Don’t be shy about switching, or calling your current provider and threatening to leave—a move that may yield some offers you won\'t find on the website. You could also drop your landline, for modest savings, or your TV service. Cutting cable or satellite TV is more ripe for significant savings, especially with the arrival of web-based cable-substitute services such as youTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, and PlayStation Vue. However, these services tend to be moneysavers only for those who want to downsize their channel array. You can ditch paying for TV entirely by spending $40 or so on a new antenna that allows you to receive pristine over-the-air digital broadcasts of the major networks, and often other programming, too. Don’t be surprised if you save more than $30 a month by switching—or at least reducing—your home telecom service. (You could, for example, trade your $70 Basic Cable package for a $40 online plan with YouTubeTV or Hulu With Live TV.) The potential 25-year benefit: nearly $18,000.

        {title: "Annual Savings", content: '1. Reduce your insurance premiums.Review your homeowner’s and auto insurance policies at least every year for changes that could save you money. Even if you don\'t opt for an entirely new carrier, a host of moves can help you reduce premiums. For example, consolidating all the policies you hold with one company typically earns a discount of between 5% and 25% on each. If you\'re insuring an older car, its optional collision and comprehensive coverage may no longer make make financial sense, say experts, if the maximum claim payout (the vehicle\'s value minus your deductible) drops to 10% or less of the total annual premium for those two coverages. And for almost any insurance policy, increasing your deductible almost invariably reduces the premium—and, of course, your financial risk. Whether or not you change coverage, shop around for your insurance, since premiums can range widely. Just how widely is difficult to assess when it comes to home insurance, but the evidence is clear when it comes to insuring your car. Based on pricing car insurance for a sample driver (a single 30-year-old male driving a 2011 Toyota Camry), ValuePenguin found the least expensive carriers nationally (GEICO and Erie) offered rates that were 30% below the national average for that driver and car. That difference, of about $450 a year, would add up to about $22,000 over 25 years.', chapter: "Saving and Growing Your Money"},

        {title: "Checking or Savings? Which is better?", content: 'When comparing checking and savings accounts, you may find that one is better suited than another to your needs, and in some cases you may benefit most from using both. Here are some questions to consider when shopping around for a checking or savings account. What are the fees associated with the account? For example, is there a monthly maintenance fee? Is there a minimum balance requirement that needs to be met? Does a savings account come with an ATM card or a debit card? Are there daily limits on ATM withdrawals for checking accounts? Are there daily limits on deposits for a checking or savings account? Does the account earn interest, and, if so, what is the APY? You should also check to see whether the bank offers any special perks for opening an account. “Banks are highly competitive in a ridiculously low-interest-rate environment, and there are occasional incentives that could make a checking or savings account more attractive,” O’Donnell says. For example, you may be able to join a debit card rewards or discount program that could save you money, or you could take advantage of promotional deals for opening other accounts, such as a money market or certificate of deposit account. Lastly, keep in mind the kind of access you need when it comes to banking. Whether you choose a checking or savings account, consider whether the bank offers the online and mobile banking tools you need to manage your money digitally, the number of ATM locations, and whether branch banking is available, if that’s something you occasionally use.', chapter: "Banking"},
